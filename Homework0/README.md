# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I really like the idea. I like not having to do unnecessary work where I don't see it to be unnecessary. I'm still motivated to do my work. I think it would be harder to do if ungrading was all there was, such as if no one had ever recieved any grades. I think having recieved grades before, I have a good knowledge of how to turn in good, clean work vs if I hadn't been graded maybe I wouldn't.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think I will be more excited to try things. I don't know what impact it might have yet. I think the biggest issue for me is a time constraint. I like the emphasis on growing vs perfection.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
